## B Enumerated Endings for Each Stage in Phase I
1. Stage One
   - *Ending 1.1*<br>
     Tone: teasing, lighthearted, and friendly<br>
     Daiyu (covering her mouth with a smile): Though you’re a bit mad, your words are quite amusing. Well then, why don’t you keep talking about your people and things for a while? Consider it a little entertainment for me, if you don’t mind.
   - *Ending 1.2*<br>
     Tone: nervous, cautious, reserved (referencing how Daiyu behaves upon entering the Jia Household)<br>
     Daiyu (calmly, with a hint of unease): What you’re saying is quite new to me. I’ll keep it in mind; that’s all.
   - *Ending 1.3*<br>
     Tone: a little bit irritated (if the player triggers the word "character"). (In the Qing Dynasty, actors held a low status, and in one chapter of the book, when Lin Daiyu is told that an actor resembles her, she immediately turns hostile.)<br>
     Daiyu (frowning): When you say “character,” do you mean like a lowly stage actor? And what exactly are you? Hiding under the lake, yet you dare mock me?
   - *Ending 1.4*<br>
     Tone: thoughtful, rhetorical, and questioning<br>
     Daiyu (insisting): No matter how much you jest, all you can do is send your messages through this lake. I dare say, the world I belong to is the real one, while yours, on the other hand, seems the false one!
   - *Ending 1.5*<br>
     Tone: Losing interest (Game over)<br>
     Daiyu (politely): I’m sorry, but I really don’t follow what you’re saying. It’s getting late, and I should be on my way.

2. Stage Two
   - *Ending 2.1*<br>
     Tone: Trusting, gentle, gradually becoming friends with the player<br>
     Daiyu (with faint tears on her cheeks, yet still smiling softly): Thank you for telling me all of this. Your world is truly fascinating, and as for mine... Now, I honestly don’t know how to go back and face my own life. 

   - *Ending 2.2*<br>
     Tone: shocked, counterintuitive (Lin Daiyu is someone who strongly relies on intuition and emotions to navigate life.)<br>
     Lin Daiyu (pale): You know all of this... so much... Then what about everything I've truly experienced in the Jia Household? What does it all even mean? The laughter, the tears, the love, the pain... were they all just... illusions?

   - *Ending 2.3*<br>
     Tone: Shocked, sorrowful, despairing (if the player talks about her death and Bao-yu’s marriage)<br>
     Daiyu (suddenly coughing up blood): So that’s how it is... everything was a lie? You knew my fate all along... If I had known, I would’ve rather become a nun or gone back and died early. Living like this, controlled by others, is worse than death.

   - *Ending 2.4*<br>
     Tone: displeased and confused (Game over)<br>
     Daiyu (angrily): Enough already. Why go through all this trouble telling me such nonsense? It’s all just crazy talk. It’s getting late, and I should be heading back.

3. Stage Three
   - *Ending 3.1*<br>
     Tone: Gentle, lively, and open-minded (One of the shining aspects of Daiyu’s character is her belief that "everything has a spirit." She is willing to respect all forms of existence in the world, even feeling sorrowful over fallen flowers.")<br>
     Daiyu: Thank you for saying this. I feel much better. I just thought that everything may have a spirit in truth—flowers, plants, trees all have their own essence. (She looks at the lake, her voice filled with wonder.) So, I too am another form of life—just like now, I can chat with you and pass the time learning about your world. Isn’t that proof of my living existence?

   - *Ending 3.2*<br>
     Tone: Passive, resilient, resigned<br>
     Daiyu (wiping away her tears): In the end, the world you belong to, I can never see. No matter what, I still have to go back and face the ending that belongs to me… After all, even if my life is but a story, it is still mine to live.

   - *Ending 3.3*<br>
     Tone: cautious, perceptive, sharp<br>
     Daiyu (after a moment of contemplation, her voice calm but probing): What you say... leaves me with some doubts.  If characters have no life, how can I be here, talking to you? And if characters do have lives, why would the author give them such tragic endings? And why would you, the readers, find pleasure in watching us suffer?

   - *Ending 3.4*<br>
     Tone: Breakdown, not comforted (Game over)<br>
     Daiyu (tears flowing uncontrollably): I'm sorry, but I still cannot accept this... Perhaps you don’t realize how difficult it is for me to bear what you’ve said. Ah, why… Why did you have to tell me all this? It’s getting late, and I should be going now.

4. Stage Four
   - *Ending 4.1*<br>
     Tone: Longing to enter the real world but powerless to do so (If the player sparks her curiosity about the real world)<br>
     Daiyu (suddenly lost in thought): After all we’ve spoken of, how wonderful it would be if I could truly enter your world... (Her finger, hovering above the lake, suddenly dips into the water.)<br>
     *A small glowing dot appears on the screen. When the player taps it, ripple effects spread across the app screen, followed by the display: “Unlocked Ending [Touch of Fate]”* <br>
     Daiyu (pulling her hand back abruptly, pausing for a moment, then suddenly smiling with understanding): How lovely... this is enough, isn’t it? (She rises gently, her tone carrying a sense of acceptance.) I must go now.

   - *Ending 4.2*<br>
     Tone: Reluctant to part, already considering the player a close friend (if intimacy level is at its highest)<br>
     Daiyu (wiping her tears again, her voice soft and emotional): Am I crying again? How embarrassing... (She pauses, then smiles faintly.) Well, I was thinking, if we existed in the same time and place, perhaps we could have become kindred spirits. After this farewell, I don’t know when we’ll meet again—since I came here empty-handed, let me pluck a flower as a token of remembrance.<br>
     *A small glowing dot appears on the screen, with a lotus petal at its center. When the player taps it, the screen displays: “Unlocked Ending [Withered Lotus Remains]”* <br>
     Daiyu (with a gentle smile): “The autumn gloom lingers, frost descends late; the withered lotus remains to listen to the sound of rain.” I must go now. Until we meet again, if fate allows.

   - *Ending 4.3*<br>
     Tone: Positive, hopeful to change the plot’s direction (if the player triggers keywords related to "changing the plot")<br>
     Daiyu (smiling): No matter what, thank you for showing me this possibility. I hope that someday, when you open the novel Dream of the Red Chamber, you’ll discover a different ending.<br>
     The screen displays: “Unlocked Ending [Resolution to Change]”

   - *Ending 4.4*<br>
     Tone: Skeptical, resilient, rational, and eloquent<br>
     Daiyu (with a sigh): Long ago, Zhuang Zhou dreamed of being a butterfly, wondering, “Was it Zhuang Zhou who dreamed of the butterfly, or the butterfly who dreamed of Zhuang Zhou?” Now, in my dream, I see your messages, and I no longer know what is real and what is an illusion—But how can you be sure that you are not trapped within a history book or a play? Could I, in my world, find records of you?<br>
     Screen displays: “Unlocked Ending [Life as a Play]”<br>
     Daiyu (with a mischievous smile): Don’t take it to heart—I’m only teasing you...
